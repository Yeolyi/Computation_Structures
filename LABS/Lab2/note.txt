If we set the inputs of a particular CMOS gate to voltages that correspond to valid logic levels, we would expect the static power dissipation of the gate to be essentially zero.

To decrease the output rise time of a CMOS gate one could increase the width of all pfets.

Number of mosfets needed to implement "XOR": 10
Number of mosfets needed to implement "A > B": 6
