Problem 1. CMOS VTC

maximum value for VIL: 0.9
minimum value for VIL: 1.2581
low noise margin: 0.6
high noise margin: 1.4419
PFET width to center VTC: 35
revised low noise margin: 0.9387
reivsed high noise margin: 0.9871

The problem is that the VTC isn't centered because in the manufacturing process we're modeling, n-channel MOSFETs have much better conductance than p-channel MOSFETs.

by sizing the MOSFETs so that the VTC is centered, we maximize the noise immunity of the inverter.




Problem 2. Contamination and propagation times

t_c,1 falling input: 20.433
t_p,1 falling input: 114.199
t_c,2 rising input: 11.74
t_p,2 rising input: 35.22
t_cd: 11.74
t_pd: 114.199




Problem 3. CMOS buffers?

Suppose we tried to build a CMOS buffer using an NFET pullup and PFET pulldown — what bad thing would happen?

lowest observed voltage for out1: 0.5
highest -: 2.5
lowest observed voltage for out2: 1
highest -: 1.99
lowest observed voltage for out3: 1.5
highest -: 1.5

This is why we don't use PFETs in pulldown circuits or NFETs in pullup circuits — in that configuration we observe threshold drops in the max and min output voltages, which accumulate and cause the buffers to produce meaningless outputs.
